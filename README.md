## What is ***X4Recon*** specifically for Kali or Termux `(ROOT)`?
This tool functions to limit access to certain device connections on a local Wi-Fi network. The mechanism is carried out by scanning all devices connected to the local network via IP Gateway, then performing ARP Spoofing to trick the target device, and finally blocking the device's traffic with the help of firewall rules (iptables). This tool is useful for testing network security or education about MITM (Man-In-The-Middle) techniques and network traffic control.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è What are the risks involved?

This tool is intended **only for educational and authorized penetration testing purposes**. Unauthorized use is strictly prohibited and can result in legal consequences.

### ‚ùó Legal Risks
- Performing ARP spoofing or traffic blocking on public or unauthorized networks can **violate cybersecurity laws** (e.g., Indonesia‚Äôs UU ITE or international cybercrime laws).
- May be considered as **unauthorized access or denial-of-service (DoS)** attacks.

### ‚ùó Technical Risks
- Can disrupt the **internet connection of target devices**, making them unable to access the internet.
- May cause instability on the local network or overload the router.
- Could unintentionally **affect your own connection** if misconfigured.

### ‚ùó Detection Risks
- Activities such as ARP spoofing can be **detected by intrusion detection systems (IDS/IPS)**.
- Your device MAC address may be **blacklisted or banned** from the network.

### ‚ùó Ethical Considerations
- Unauthorized testing can breach **privacy, confidentiality, and trust**.
- Always obtain **explicit permission** before testing on any network that you do not own.
